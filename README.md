# Lithology_Identification
Lithology Identification for Geothermal Resources using Machine Learning (Unsupervised)

## Project task

Here, we implemented 5 Unsupervised Learning models namely;
* K-means clustering, 
* Hierarchical clustering using ward linkage, 
* K-mode clustering, 
* Birch, 
* Mini-batch kmeans

In identifying lithologies for a Geothermal Well. This lithologies present can be seen in the Figure below
